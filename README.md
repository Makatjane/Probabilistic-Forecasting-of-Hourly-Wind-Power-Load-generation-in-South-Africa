# Probabilistic-Forecasting-of-Hourly-Wind-Power-Load-generation-in-South-Africa
In this notebook, I have developed a probabilistic forecasting of total wind power generation in South Africa. I firstly employed the classical decomposition to extract the trend. Secondly filtered the series suing Kalman filter, fit GBDt and filly combine Kalman filters with GBDT
